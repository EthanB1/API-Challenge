# Financial-Planning-with-API
I have decided to start a FinTech consultancy firm, and I  want to make a difference by working on projects with high social impact in local communities. I just won my first contract to help one of the biggest credit unions in my area. I want to create a tool that helps their members enhance their financial health. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the credit union asked me to develop a prototype application to demo in the next credit union assembly.

The credit union board wants to allow the union's members to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.
In this activity, I will  using APIs as part of the technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.

The first will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second tool will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca 
API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. I will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.

### Steps:
1. Collect Crypto Prices Using the requests Library
2. Collect Investments Data Using Alpaca: SPY (stocks) and AGG (bonds)
3. Perform a Savings Health Analysis
4.  Retirement Planning Using Monte Carlo Simulation to Predict Future Returns
